# Multer

## Basics

Multer is used to upload multipart form data

Multer is a middleware for that.

We will allow the user to upload photos on updateMe

Require it in your routes file and configure it

```javascript
const upload = multer({
  dest: 'public/img/users',
});
```

```javascript
router.patch('/update-data', upload.single('photo'), userController.updateMe);
```

Multer will put data and information onto the request object when called as a
middleware like this
